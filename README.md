# CSharp-Web-Project-2021

This is a Web Application created with the idea to serve as my C# Web Project for finishing the ASP.NET Core Module at <a href=softuni.bg>SoftUni<\a>.

The project itself represents a web application of a Culture Center which offers a number of services open to the public, such as
library, bookstore, cinema, restaurant, internet cafe, conference hall and lounge. The web application provides hosting of the business of
the establishment and presents a UI with a possibility to create, update, delete the user profile and also to make reservations for the provided services,
ask questions, contact customer service/information desk. The account also presents the customer/user with additional discounts and preferences connected 
with the service at hand.

The website is planned to be custom made with original images and discriptions and the idea to recreate a real user experience with detailed information.
